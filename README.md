# FakeNewsDetection-FCA-ML

## Overview
This repository contains the source code and materials for my Final Degree Project in Software Engineering aimed at detecting fake news using a combination of Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. The goal is to improve the classification and understanding of fake news by combining traditional machine learning models with FCA for added interpretability.

## Features
- Data Collection: Using pre-existing datasets of labeled news articles.
- Preprocessing: Text cleaning, tokenization, and feature extraction.
- Modeling: Implementation of ML algorithms (SVM, Neural Networks, NLP methods).
- FCA Integration: To discover hidden patterns in the data.
- Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score metrics.
- Shiny App: Interactive web app for visualizing results.
